| `x += 1`| Assign the value of x + 1 to x |
| `x -= 1`| Assign the value of x - 1 to x |

***
## Lists

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `l = [100, 21, 88, 3]`	| Assign a list containing the integers 100, 21, 88, and 3 to the variable l |
|` l = list()` | Create an empty list and assign the result to l |
|` l[0] `| Return the first value in the list l |
| `l[-1]`	| Return the last value in the list l|
| `l[1:3]` | Return a slice (list) containing the second and third values of l|
| `len(l)` | Return the number of elements in l |
| `sum(l)` | Return the sum of the values of l|

## Dictionaries

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|``` d = {"CA": "Canada", "GB": "Great Britain", "IN": "India"}``` | Create a dictionary with keys of "CA", "GB", and "IN" and corresponding values of of "Canada", "Great Britain", and "India" |
| ```d["GB"]``` | Return the value from the dictionary d that has the key "GB" |
| ```d.get("AU","Sorry")``` | Return the value from the dictionary d that has the key "AU", or the string "Sorry" if the key "AU" is not found in d |
| ```d.keys()``` | Return a list of the keys from d|
| ```d.values()``` | Return a list of the values from d |
| ```d.items()``` | Return a list of (key, value) pairs from d |


***
## Modules and Functions
The body of a function is defined through indentation

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `import random` | import random Import the module random |
| `from random import random` | Import the function random from the module random |
| ``` def calculate(addition_one,addition_two,exponent=1,factor=1): ```<br> ``` result = (value_one + value_two) ** exponent * factor ```<br>``` return result ```| Define a new function calculate with two required and two optional named arguments which calculates and returns a result |
| ```addition(3,5,factor=10)``` | Run the addition function with the values 3 and 5 and the named argument 10 |

| `x == 5 and name == "alfred"`	| Test whether x is equal to 5 and name is equal to "alfred" |
| `5 in l` 				| Checks whether the value 5 exists in the list l |
| `"GB" in d` | Checks whether the value "GB" exists in the keys for d |


***
## Statements and Loops
The body of if statements and loops are defined through indentation


Test the value of the variable x and run the code body based on the value

`if x > 5:
    print("{} is greater than five".format(x))
elif x < 0:
    print("{} is negative".format(x))
else:
    print("{} is between zero and five".format(x))`


Iterate over each value in l, running the code in the body of the loop with each iteration.

`for value in l:
    print(value)`


Run the code in the body of the loop until the value of x is no longer less than 10

`while x < 10:
    x += 1`
